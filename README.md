## Introduction

Hey friend and welcome to my little repo of custom made bash scripts. 

[<a href="#top">Top</a>]

## How To Use

> NOTE: I am not responsible for any damages done to your machine. Running and interacting with these bash scripts means that you have a basic understanding of the Bash scripting language. If you do not know Bash, then please refer to https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html

Most of my scripts are written for linux as I primarily operate [Ubuntu 24.04.01 LTS]() on both my laptop and desktop computers.

To use any of these <code>.sh</code> scripts on your linux machine:

1. Open Terminal
   1. <code>ctrl + alt + T</code> on your keyboard
2. Give the file permissions to run
   1. <code>cd Path/To/Where/You/Downloaded/update-linux.sh</code>
   2. <code>chmod +x update-linux.sh</code>
3. Run the file
   1. <code>sh ./update-linux.sh</code>
4. Sit back and enjoy
   1. :P

> NOTE: To remove chmod permissions from the <code>update-linux.sh</code> file, follow the same steps as above but on step #2 run <code>chmod -x update-linux.sh</code>
